# MarkdownAPI Playground

Interactive demo that proves the format works. Paste a spec, chat with it, watch real API calls happen.

## Concept

1. User pastes a MarkdownAPI spec
2. User asks natural language questions ("create a user", "list all orders")
3. System parses the spec, generates the request, executes it
4. User sees the actual response

## Why this matters

Nothing proves "it works" like watching it work. This is the visceral, shareable proof that MarkdownAPI delivers on its promise.
